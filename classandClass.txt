EIn Java, `class` and `Class` are distinct concepts, and they serve different purposes:

1. **`class` (lowercase)**:
   - `class` is a **keyword** in Java, used to define a new class.
   - It is part of the syntax to declare a class structure. For example:
     ```java
     public class MyClass {
         // class contents here
     }
     ```

2. **`Class` (uppercase)**:
   - `Class` is a **class** in the `java.lang` package. It represents the **meta-class** of objects, allowing runtime reflection.
   - Using `Class`, you can get information about a class, such as its name, methods, fields, etc.
   - An example use:
     ```java
     Class<?> clazz = MyClass.class; // Gets the Class object for MyClass
     System.out.println(clazz.getName()); // Prints "MyClass"
     ```

In summary:
- `class` is a Java keyword to define classes.
- `Class` is an actual Java class used for reflection to inspect and manipulate classes at runtime.
